\chapter{Using the template}

\section{Compiling}

\begin{important}
You'll need to use lualatex\marginnote{xelatex will probably work too!} when you're compiling unless you take out the font changes under \textit{include/structure.tex}
\end{important}

\section{Boxes}

The template has 6 different boxes you can use:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Definition
  \item Example*
  \item \textit{Solution}*%\marginnote{*Are paired together, but can be used separately.}
  \item Note
  \item Important note
  \item Further exercises
\end{itemize}
The definition and example boxes are numbered and can have titled added.

\subsection{Definition box}

\begin{definition}[Title]
  Definition here
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Definition here
\end{definition}

\subsection{Example and solution boxes}

\begin{example}{Title}
  Example here
\end{example}

\begin{example}{}
  Example here
\end{example}

%By default the solution box has a height of 4 cm, but it can be changed by including `[height=?cm]' where ? is replaced with a value. e.g.

\begin{example}[height=2.5cm]{Title}
  Example here
\end{example}

The solution and example boxes can also be made separely by using `examplebox' and `solutionbox'. The examplebox can also be made with a title and the height of the solutionbox can be set.

\begin{examplebox}{Title}
  Example here
\end{examplebox}

\begin{examplebox}
  Example here
\end{examplebox}

% When making a solutionbox you must include `\vspace\{1em\}}'. By default it is shifted up 1em to be aligned with the examplebox.

\vspace{1em}
\begin{solutionbox}
  Solution here
\end{solutionbox}

% And again, the height can be modified. By default it is 4 cm.

\vspace{1em}
\begin{solutionbox}[height=2cm]
  Solution here
\end{solutionbox}

\subsection{Note boxes}

\begin{note}
  Note here
\end{note}

\subsection{Important note boxes}

\begin{important}
  Important note here
\end{important}

\subsection{Further exercises}

\section{Writing grid}

\GridOn

% To turn on the writing grid simply make sure that `\GridOn' is included on the page you want the grid.

\begin{note}
  The solutionbox is transparent so the gridlines will be visible through the box.
\end{note}

\section{Cloze}\marginnote{Shoutout to Hubert because this code was yoinked out of his booklets}

You can add spaces for students to fill in words and choose to show/hide these words (for printing a teacher copy perhaps?). It will also look at what the cut out words are and make sure that an appropriate amount of space is left.

% To use cloze, simply write `\Close{your word here}'

For example \Cloze{here}

% Ensure that `\ShowClozetrue' is just under \begin{document} to show the words, and removing `\ShowClozefalse' will hide the words.

\section{Margin notes}
You can also add marginnotes. \marginnote{Like this.}

The notes will alternate sides depending on odd/even pages, the margins will also change by 0.5 cm on the left and right to allow slightly more room for marginnotes. This can be disabled by removing `twoside' from the documentclass.
